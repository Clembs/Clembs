## About me
Hi, I'm Cl√©ment, a 17 y/o french CS student at IUT Paul Sabatier, passioned by computers and design.

When I'm not studying... or wasting time on the Internet, I like to create new worlds and software, fine tuning them so they're as close to my vision.

### Knowledge
Over the years, I specialized working with web technologies, my stack of choice currently being SvelteKit + TypeScript + SCSS.

I'm also currently learning other languages like Ada, Java, C and Python through school, and Kotlin on my own.

Software I use include Fedora, Firefox, VSCodium, Figma, among others.

I want to always improve at my craft and will therefore update this section as I do.

### Notable projects
- [clembs.com](https://clembs.com), my personal portfolio website.
- [CRBT](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/CRBT), a Discord bot to help speed up community management.
