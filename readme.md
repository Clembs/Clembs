## About me
Hi, I'm Cl√©ment, a 17 y/o french IT student at Paul Sabatier University, passioned by design and computers.
When I'm not studying or wasting time on the Internet, I like to create new worlds and software, and try to fine tune them so they're extra nice.

### Knowledge
I mostly know and use TypeScript and web technologies ([Svelte](https://svelte.dev) my beloved), and I aim to learn other languages like Kotlin or Go.
I work on both front and back-end, although I'm no expert on either.
Software I use include Windows, VSCodium, Figma, just to name a few.
I always want to keep improving and learn more, therefore this section shall update as I do.

### Notable projects
- [clembs.com](https://clembs.com), my personal portfolio website.
- [CRBT](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/CRBT), a Discord bot to help speed up community management.
