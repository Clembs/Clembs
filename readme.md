## About me
Hi, I'm Clément, a 18 y/o french computer science student passioned by computers and design.

When I'm not studying or wasting time on the Internet, I like to create applications that are useful and pleasant to use.

### Knowledge
Over the years, I specialized working with web technologies, my stack of choice currently being SvelteKit + TypeScript + SCSS + PostgreSQL.

I'm also knowledgeable on languages such as Java, Ada, C, Python or PHP, although I did not produce any signficant projects with them.

### Notable projects
- [Islands](https://github.com/Clembs/Islands), highly customizable mini profiles for everyone.
- [clembs.com](https://clembs.com), my personal portfolio website.
- [CRBT](https://crbt.app), a Discord bot to help speed up community management.

### Other projects

- [De la mécanique au numérique](https://mecanique-numerique.vercel.app), an exposition retracing the history of computing since the mechanical era (in french only).
