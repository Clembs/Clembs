## About me
Hi, I'm Cl√©ment, a 17 y/o french high-schooler, passioned by design and computers.
When I'm not studying, socializing or just wasting time on the Internet, I like to create new worlds, software and try to fine tune them so they're extra nice.

### Knowledge
I mostly know and use TypeScript and other web technologies ([Svelte](https://svelte.dev) my beloved), though I do learn other languages that I want to use.
I do both front- and back-end, although I'm no real expert on the latter.
Software I use include Windows, VSCode, Adobe XD, Figma, just to name a few.
I always want to keep improving and learn more, therefore this section shall update as I do.

### Notable projects
- [CRBT](https://github.com/CRBT-Team/CRBT), a Discord server management bot.
- [Streaming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/Clembs), which should be every Saturday afternoon.
- *[TBD]*
